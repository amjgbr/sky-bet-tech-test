I could go on further but this is work in progress 
Using create react app to get up and running quicker
Added Redux
Create a websocket middleware
Using Material UI for styling
React hooks

I've not followed a tdd approach but at this point i would go back and write the tests. 

If you would like to see this i can continue with this if needed. 


## Current issues

Defaults to primary markets rather than giving an option
Improve styling
Still to write tests
No bet slip
Outcome status to better reflect in the ui
Where stirngs are used, move them to a constants file
